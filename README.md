# Naff' Said

What is Naff? **Not A Frontend Framework**. It's not a library for developing client-side web applications. It's best to write web apps with real frameworks like React (which I consider a framework) or Angular (or Vue or one of the many, many others). 

Naff focuses on a few things:

1. Manipulating, querying, and exploring the DOM directly.
2. Building web components.
3. Quick, ugly prototyping.

Naff's API is inspired by JQuery, at least those parts that involve the DOM and HTML.
